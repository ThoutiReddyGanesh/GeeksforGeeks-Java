## Problem

You are playing a game with  **n**  people standing in a circle, numbered from  **1** to **n**. Starting from person 1, every  **kth**  person is eliminated in a circular fashion. The process continues until only one person remains.
Given integers n and k, return the position (1-based index) of the person who will survive.

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Firstly, the person at position 2 is killed, then the person at position 4 is killed, then the person at position 1 is killed. 
Finally, the person at position 5 is killed. So the person at position 3 survives. 
```

```
Input: n = 7, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The elimination order is 3 → 6 → 2 → 7 → 5 → 1, and the person at position 4 survives.
```

```java
class Solution {
	public int josephus(int n, int k) {
		// code here
		ArrayList<Integer> al = new ArrayList<>();
		for (int i = 1; i<=n; i++) {
			al.add(i); }
			int j = 0;
			while (al.size()>1) {
				j = (j + k-1)%al.size();
				al.remove(j);
			}
			return al.get(0);
		}
	}

```
