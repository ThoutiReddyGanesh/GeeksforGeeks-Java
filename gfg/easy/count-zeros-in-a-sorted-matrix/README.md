![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given a  **n * n** binary Square Matrix where each row and column of the matrix is sorted in ascending order. Find the total number of  **zeros**  present in the matrix.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: mat[][] = [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,1]]
 
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The first, second and third row contains 3, 2 and 1
zeroes respectively.
```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1,1], [1,1]]
 
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no zeroes in any of the rows.
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int countZeros(int[][] grid) {
        // code here
        int c=0;
                for(int i=0;i<grid.length;i++){
                    for(int j=0;j<grid[i].length;j++){
                        if(grid[i][j]==0)c++;
                    }
                }
                return c;

            }
}

```
